#    even-vertical
#            Panes are spread evenly from top to bottom.

#    main-horizontal
#            A large (main) pane is shown at the top of the window and the remaining panes are
#            spread from left to right in the leftover space at the bottom.  Use the
#            main-pane-height window option to specify the height of the top pane.

#    main-vertical
#            Similar to main-horizontal but the large pane is placed on the left and the others
#            spread from top to bottom along the right.  See the main-pane-width window option.

#    tiled   Panes are spread out as evenly as possible over the window in both rows and columns.
